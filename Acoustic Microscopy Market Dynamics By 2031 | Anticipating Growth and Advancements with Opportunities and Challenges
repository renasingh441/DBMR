Market Analysis and Insights :

Global Acoustic Microscopy Market

Data Bridge Market Research analyses the acoustic microscopy market will exhibit a CAGR of 7.00% for the forecast period of 2022-2029 and is likely to reach the USD 1,718.04 million by 2029.

Acoustic microscopy utilizes sound waves to provide and magnify the picture of small objects. This is a non-destructive approach for obtaining visible images of interior characteristics of solid things such as delamination, fissures, and voids. The inspection of several equipment including optical devices, printed circuit boards, and others, is made easier by acoustic microscopy. The benefits of using acoustic microscopy include the ability to replace various non-destructive imaging techniques such as x-ray radiography and infrared imaging. It delivers reliable data and is employed in various industries such as bioscience, semiconductors, material science, nanotechnology, and others.

The rising need for micro and nanotechnology for research and development will act as a key element driving market expansion. The acoustic microscopy market is also being driven by factors such as expansion in safety standards by governments and other international organizations and advancements in microscope technology. Furthermore, increased adoption of acoustic technology by a growing number of manufacturing firms for error detection and product quality checks will result in enhancement of growth rate of acoustic microscopy market. Also, growth in the number of end-use industries and development activities will act as a major factor influencing the growth of acoustic microscopy market. Similarly, a small break in a solar cell could be detected using an acoustic microscope. Scanning biological materials like cells and bone with acoustic microscopy has a wide range of uses. These various applications of acoustic microscopy are expected to cushion the acoustic microscopy market’s growth rate.

Moreover, higher power generation and expanding use of acoustic microscopes will create beneficial opportunities for the growth of the market. Additionally, the increased investment for microscopy R&D and emerging new markets will act as market driver and further boost new opportunities in the forecast period mentioned above.

However, the high initial investment and overall operational costs will hamper the market’s growth rate. Also, the scarcity of qualified professionals will further pose a challenge to the market. Another factor involves the implementation of excise tax and significant customs duty on acoustic microscopes will obstruct the market’s growth.
